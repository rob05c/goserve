I'm a software engineer with a B.S. in Computer Science and 5 years' experience in application-level development. I'm currently working on my Masters, hoping to focus on parallel processing and distributed computing.<br /><br />

My strongest language is C++. However, I consider myself a polyglot, and I believe a good software engineer should be able to learn any language necessary. I prefer functional programming, and am continually learning more about the paradigm.
